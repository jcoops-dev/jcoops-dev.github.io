[‚ÜêReturn to projects](/projects/)  

## Overview

A collection of other projects I have worked on. Gradually being updated.

## The Astral Project  
  
A short scavenger hunt game about self-isolation during the pandemic, prepared for my Digital Games course during my masters degree.  
  
WASD or arrow keys to move.  
Space to interact with things.  
Explore all 5 rooms to unlock a secret ending!

## Escape the Zoo  
  
Another short Godot prototype, this one inspired by the 2006 WildTangent game: [Penguins!](https://www.wildtangent.com/p/arcade/penguins/?srsltid=AfmBOopigC97WFEjmoLSb__DCukns-5XmFM_yp7aUq6cP_HsQzjCdEAN).

Sadly I lost the original project files from 5 years ago, learning a valuable lesson in version control.

The game is available for download from my [GitHub](https://github.com/jcoops-dev/ZooEscape.git).
