## Overview

As part of my AI-Unity integration project, I've explored running an AI image generator local to my computer, with the eventual intention of using player input to generate in-game images.  
This series of images presents the results of my experiments with Stable Diffusion, including prompt structuring and generation settings, tackling a wide variety of categorized subject matter.  
My goal, upon completion of this sub-project, is to understand how best to format image prompt data to be used in an interactive environment.

## Concept Art
